# Survival Analysis on Lung Cancer Patients

The key aim of our project is to perform Survival Analysis. We want to give the basic idea of what survival analysis is and how it can be done. We will be taking a sample medical data either lung disease or cancer dataset and apply survival analysis on that dataset. We will determine survival rate of patients.

Survival analysis is a branch of statistics for analyzing the expected duration of time until one or more events occur. The method is also known as duration analysis or duration modelling, time-to-event analysis, reliability analysis and event history analysis.

Survival probability is the probability that an individual (e.g., patient) survives from the time origin (e.g., diagnosis of cancer) to a specified future time t. For example, S (200) = 0.7 means that after 200 days has passed since the diagnosis of cancer, the patientâ€™s survival probability has dropped to 0.7.

The following questions are analyzed using the survival analysis:
- A percentage of people who have survived up until a certain time.
- The rate of their deaths
- Recognizing how variables affect survival

Steps followed are:

  - Import Necessary Dependencies
  - Read and Load the Dataset
  - Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Data Visualization of Target Variables
